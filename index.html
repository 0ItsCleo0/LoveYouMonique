        <p>This was the first day a message was sent. I saw your post and, if I remember correctly, you were the only person I messaged first. When I messaged you, I never thought anything would come from it. I didn’t think we’d still be talking today. I couldn’t fathom how much you would mean to me in the future. Little did I know, I just met the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.<br><br>Message sent at 7:50am</p>

        <p>One week into us talking, we made it official. Despite knowing how far apart we were... despite having the knowledge we weren't going to be able to hold each other for a long time, we decided to go for it. I don't think either of us knew how hard that distance would hit us at the time. However, we both found something in each other that isn't easy to find elsewhere.<br><br>Message sent at 2:18am</p>

        <p>The day I got to see that beautiful face for the first time. I was planning on sending a pic of myself before you, but you surprised me. I remember you second thinking it and getting nervous about sharing this picture of yourself. I can't express the feelings I got when I saw that picture for the first time. "This cute girl right here is talking to me?! Like... AHHHH!!!". Then, I shared a picture of myself and you said I was pretty and I just melted.<br><br>Message sent at 5:36pm</p>

        <p>The first time we got on a call together. This was terrifying for me. It was awkward and I was stumbling over my words. I know you were nervous as well. You were in bed holding a pillow. I don't remember what we talked about. I just know I was struggling and letting you hear my voice for the first time was not easy. I spent most of the call rambling and trying to fill any empty space in hopes of you finding me interesting enough to continue talking to me. I guess it worked...<br><br>Call at 7:14pm</p>

        <p>The night before I was up preparing this server for us and it has become something beyond important to me. This server is our own little world with so many memories archived in it. There is so much time and effort put into this relationship and it's happened here on this server. Everything we do together has its own spot here, and it's so beautiful going through this server, looking back at all that we've accomplished.<br><br>Server sent at 6:10am</p>

        <p>The first "I love you". This was so very unexpected for me, but you seemed so sure of yourself, and it felt so damn sincere. We were on call and it was a slip up. I didn't know how to respond. At the time, I was still questioning the relationship and trying to understand how it would all work. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to respond with "I love you too", but I was scared to accept that as a possibility. Of course, that didn't take long to deal with. The last thing I heard before going to sleep that night was "I love you" and it felt so overwhelmingly positive to hear that from you.</p>

        <p>This was the first physical gift. It was a Cookies & Cream Frappé from The Coffee Club. I know you didn't really want me to do it, but you said you weren't having a great morning and I wanted to cheer you up with something I thought you'd enjoy. Unfortunately, the frappé was somewhat melted, but it was definitely worth it. Rather, you like me spending money on you or not doesn't take away from the feeling I get when I get to gift you something I think you will really like. It's one of the ways I like to show my love and appreciation.<br><br>Order arrived at 6:35pm</p>

        <p>This was the day Luna was born. I bought her a month previously because you were in a really down mood and I wanted to give you something that you could hold since I can't be there. Luna means so very much to me for what she represents in our relationship. In long distance, the lack of touch can be one of the hardest things in the relationship and, even though Luna doesn't solve that, she can be something cuddly that reminds you of me in the dark times.</p>
